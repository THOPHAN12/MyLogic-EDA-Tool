# Expected Output for Structural Hashing (Strash) Test

## Test Case: Simple Duplicates
Input: 4 nodes (2 AND gates, 2 BUF gates)
Expected Output: 3 nodes (1 AND gate, 2 BUF gates)
Optimization: Remove 1 duplicate AND gate

## Test Case: Complex Duplicates  
Input: 6 nodes (2 AND gates, 2 OR gates, 2 BUF gates)
Expected Output: 4 nodes (1 AND gate, 1 OR gate, 2 BUF gates)
Optimization: Remove 1 duplicate AND gate, 1 duplicate OR gate

## Test Case: No Duplicates
Input: 4 nodes (1 AND gate, 1 OR gate, 2 BUF gates)
Expected Output: 4 nodes (no optimization)
Optimization: No changes needed

## Success Criteria:
- Duplicate nodes are removed
- Non-duplicate nodes are preserved
- Output functionality remains unchanged
- Node count is reduced when duplicates exist
