# Expected Output for Dead Code Elimination (DCE) Test

## Test Case: Simple Dead Code
Input: 5 nodes (1 AND gate, 1 BUF gate, 1 OR gate, 1 XOR gate)
Expected Output: 2 nodes (1 AND gate, 1 BUF gate)
Optimization: Remove 2 dead nodes (OR, XOR)

## Test Case: Complex Dead Code Chain
Input: 8 nodes (1 AND gate, 1 BUF gate, 1 OR gate, 1 XOR gate, 1 AND gate, 1 OR gate)
Expected Output: 2 nodes (1 AND gate, 1 BUF gate)
Optimization: Remove entire dead code chain (4 nodes)

## Test Case: No Dead Code
Input: 4 nodes (1 AND gate, 1 OR gate, 2 BUF gates)
Expected Output: 4 nodes (no optimization)
Optimization: No changes needed

## Success Criteria:
- Dead code nodes are removed
- Used logic nodes are preserved
- Output functionality remains unchanged
- Node count is reduced when dead code exists
